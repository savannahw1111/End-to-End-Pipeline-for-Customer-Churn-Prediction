# End-to-End-Pipeline-for-Customer-Churn-Prediction

**Stack:** Python • Pandas • DuckDB • SQL

Built a customer-level dataset by merging behavioral features with churn outcomes and performed exploratory data analysis on 6,000 customers. Cleaned and validated the data, confirmed no missing or duplicate records, and prepared it for modeling.

Used DuckDB and SQL for data transformation and feature engineering, including encoding categorical variables and creating business-driven metrics such as estimated lifetime revenue, dormancy flags, and orders per month.

The modeling and machine learning part of this project is currently in progress.
